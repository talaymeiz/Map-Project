## Overview

I have a strong passion for exploring and gathering experiences in different corners of the globe. Motivated by this desire, I chose to create Travel-Map, catering to fellow travel enthusiasts or those aspiring to embark on their journeys for the first time. This app allows users to record the locations they have visited, provide ratings and save them for future reference. A trip map can be used as a personal database for users to recall their travel experiences, but most importantly, Va allows the ability to share the memories and ideas for these trips and experiences with others :)

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend:**
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.<br>
react-map-gl: A React wrapper for Mapbox GL JS, a library for embedding interactive, customizable maps.<br>
axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the server.<br>
@mui/icons-material: Icons from the Material-UI library used for displaying star icons.<br>
The code integrates with Mapbox for rendering the map and markers. It communicates with a server to fetch and update data related to pins on the map using Axios for HTTP requests. The state is managed using React hooks, and the application includes components for user registration and login.<br>

- **Backen:**
  Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js used to create the server.<br>
Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It simplifies interactions with MongoDB databases.<br>
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store the data.<br>
bcrypt: A library for hashing and salting passwords securely.<br>
The stack includes Node.js with Express for the server, Mongoose for MongoDB interactions, bcrypt for password hashing, and MongoDB as the database. The code structure follows a RESTful API design with separate routes for pins and users.<br>

- **view:** CSS.
