## Overview

I have a strong passion for exploring and gathering experiences in different corners of the globe. Motivated by this desire, I chose to create Travel-Map, catering to fellow travel enthusiasts or those aspiring to embark on their journeys for the first time. This app allows users to record the locations they have visited, provide ratings and save them for future reference. A trip map can be used as a personal database for users to recall their travel experiences, but most importantly, Va allows the ability to share the memories and ideas for these trips and experiences with others :)
